# me-implement
 
Here is where I'll store my implementations during my process of learning(usually self-motivated, definitely not part of work for anyone) utilizing public resources. 

I don't claim any originality or rights for stuffs here. And because they are not projects, I will not build pages to demonstrate them but Readme. 

It is possible that somethings here can be used in my other projects on Github. If that may be the case, the GPL license should cover all my rights claimed.
