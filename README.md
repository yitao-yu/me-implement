# me-implement
 
Here is where I'll store my implementations during my process of learning(usually self-motivated, definitely not part of work for anyone) utilizing public resources. I claim no originality for codes here(far too simple to be original).

It is possible that somethings here can be used in my other projects on Github or for later adaptations. If that may be the case, the GPL license should cover all my rights. (But no rights I claim for other parts of the code).
